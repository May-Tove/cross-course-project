## Description

This project was a cross course project that I have worked on throughout the entire first year on Noroff Front-end Development studies. The assignment was to develop an e-commerce site for a fictional company called Rainydays, that sells outdoor jackets. The target audience is men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interests are: being outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing.

The products for the website are stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. The website itself is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data.



The frontEnd should contain the following pages:

- Home page
- Product page with a list showing all products.
- Page with product details - made with JavaScript once clicked on each product. It should also be possible to add products to cart.
- Checkout page showing what products are added to the cart
- About page
- Contact page written with JavaScript form validation



The project includes the following tasks:

- Investigate and understand the target audience
- Creating low fidelity wireframes
- Create a high fidelity prototype with colors, fonts and layout
- Develop a responsive website using HTML and pure CSS, no frameworks
- Add functionality to the page using vanilla JavaScript.
- Usa a headless CMS (in this case Wordpress) to get products from an WP Rest API
- Conducting contextual inquiry interviews and gather user data through Hotjar
- Analyze the result from user testing and do adjustments to the site if needed
- Testing of the site (WCAG guidelines and SEO)
- Documentation of the process
